# OpenCharacters
Simple little web interface for creating characters and chatting with them. It's basically a single HTML file - no server. Share characters using a link (character data is stored within the URL itself). All chat data is stored in your browser using IndexedDB. Currently only supports OpenAI APIs, but can add more later.

You can also get characters to chat with themselves using the "reply with..." button next to the "send" button. And you can enable text-to-speech to hear their conversation. Here's a demo (TTS disabled):
