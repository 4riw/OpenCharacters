# OpenCharacters
Simple little web interface for creating characters and chatting with them. It's basically a single HTML file - no server. Share characters using a link (character data is stored within the URL itself). All chat data is stored in your browser using IndexedDB. Currently only supports OpenAI APIs, but can add more later.

**Try it here:** https://josephrocca.github.io/OpenCharacters

* You can write custom "message re-writing" functions to e.g. give your characters access to the internet, or to a Stable Diffusion API, etc.
* You can share characters with a link - all character data is stored within the URL itself (there's no server, this whole project is just a one big HTML file)
* You can get characters to chat with one another using the "reply with..." button
* You can enable text-to-speech so you can hear the characters converse
* Send new feature ideas or bug reports [here](https://github.com/josephrocca/OpenCharacters/issues)
