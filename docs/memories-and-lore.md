# Memories and Lore
If you have summaries enabled in your character settings, then your character will automatically start to create "memories" once the thread/convo gets long enough. Before each reply. your character will search its memories for anything that might be relevant to the reply that it's about the write.

You can see the "search queries" that were used by your character when generating a message by tapping the brain icon that appears when you hover over a message (or when tap it on mobile).

You can type `/mem` in the chat to open the memory editor for that thread/convo so that you can edit/add/remove memories.

**Lore** is similar to memories, except that they're not chronological. You can open the lore editor for a thread by typing `/lore`, and you can add lore to your character by opening the advanced character editing options and pasting a URL to your lorebook text file. The text file should just be a list of lore entries with blank lines in between each one. You can use a service like renty.org to create hosted text files if needed.

You should think of lore like "dynamic reminders". They're like the reminder message, except that they only get loaded in when they're relevant to the current situation.

### Important
 * You can have as much lore/memories as you want - e.g. you could have thousands of entries, and it wouldn't cost any more than if you had 10 entries.
 * If you make an update to your character's lorebook URLs, then existing threads won't automatically get the update. You have to type `/lore`, and then show the hidden options and click the reload button.
